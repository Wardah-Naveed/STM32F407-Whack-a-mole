Whack a mole is a fun game implementation for your understanding useage of microcontrollers in practical life. Most of the arcade games are based on implemtation of micr-controllers. It is a blend of both hardware and software project. In order to proceed with this project you need STM32F407Vgtx board and STM32CubeIDE (any version but choose the latest ones recommended). Also Downlaod STM utility app to clean the micro-controller if the regesters are not self cleaning or are not being overwritten.
Good Luck and enjoy :)
